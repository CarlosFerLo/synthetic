# synthetic
Synthetic Cognitions framework for developing language model agents.

# Mission
In Synthetic Cognition we are commited to provide developers the latest advancements in language model agents. This way we make adoption and innovation easyer for everyone.

# Values
- Open Knowledge: All the research and products will be fully open source so everyone has access to them and the posibility to iterate on top of them.

- Innovation: We do not only make an easy way to apply current advancements, we are constantly pursuing new innovations on our field.

# Vission
We want to be the Verecel of Language Model Agents.

# Problem
- Current frameworks are based on the ReAct architecture and have no or very limited support for new advancements.
- Cloud services targeting generative AI focus on deployment of models but in the case of agents you have to manage it yourself.

# Solution
The solution is to create a new framework built from the ground up to support integral changes to the agent architecture to ease the development of new architectures and offer agent hosting services to keep developers in what they are good at, AI.

# Product
We are developping the **synthetic** library with an easy to use API but with the adaptability to suport changes in the base architecture. We are also introducing new features to agents that allow to solve fundamental problems of the current architectures.
All of the library will be designed to make deployment on the **Synthetic Cloud** fast and continuous.

# Market Oportunity
More than 400 public repositories (>100 stars) are currently dependent on langchain, including some of the leading AGI and language model agent projects.

//TODO: continue

# Customers
We are targeting language model agent developers, this engloves from those developping simple pipelines to those developing complex agent architectures. AI developers are not familiar with deployment and maintainance of servers as they are used to easy deployment t
